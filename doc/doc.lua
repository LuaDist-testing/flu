chapter('about', "About Flu", [[
Flu is a Lua binding for [FUSE](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/), which is a library allowing creation of filesystem drivers run in userspace. Flu is a high level binding, using basic Lua types rather than userdata whenever possible.

Flu tries to be complete, but is not supporting obsolete APIs. The binding is closely following the FUSE API, so in most case you can use FUSE documentation if the present page is not clear enough. The missing functions are missing because I've not used them yet. I can add them on request (a use case could be helpful for non-trivial ones).

## Support

All support is done through the [Lua mailing list](http://www.lua.org/lua-l.html).

Feel free to ask for further developments. I can't guarantee that I'll develop everything you ask, but I want my code to be as useful as possible, so I'll do my best to help you. You can also send me request or bug reports (for code and documentation) directly at [jerome.vuarand@gmail.com](mailto:jerome.vuarand@gmail.com).

## Credits

This module is written and maintained by [Jérôme Vuarand](mailto:jerome.vuarand@gmail.com). It is a fork of [LUSE](http://piratery.net/luse/), a previous Lua-FUSE binding from the same author. LUSE was low level and rather complicated to use, while Flu tries its best to be simple.

Flu is available under a [MIT-style license](LICENSE.txt).

chapter('download', "Download", [[
Flu sources are available in its [Mercurial repository](http://hg.piratery.net/flu/):

    hg clone http://hg.piratery.net/flu

Tarballs of the latest code can be downloaded directly from there: as [gz](http://hg.piratery.net/flu/get/tip.tar.gz), [bz2](http://hg.piratery.net/flu/get/tip.tar.bz2) or [zip](http://hg.piratery.net/flu/get/tip.zip).

Finally, I published some rockspecs:

    luarocks install flu
]])

chapter('installation', "Installation", [[
To build Flu from sources, edit the Makefile and then run make in the top directory:

    $ vi Makefile
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Flu obviously depends on FUSE. It currently supports FUSE API versions 25 (FUSE 2.5.x and later) and 26 (FUSE 2.6.x and later). You can select a FUSE API version in the Makefile.

Below each functon is described with the parameters they are called with, and the expected return values on normal operation. Most functions though have no return value. To express error conditions, regular Lua error should be thrown with `error`. The thrown error though have to be errno userdata values as found in the flu.errno table. For example:

    error(flu.errno.EINVAL)

They are named methods here, but they are called as Lua function, without a self parameter. To maintain state, use upvalues.

As of FUSE 2.6, there are six FUSE methods that are not bound by Flu: and `init`, `destroy`, `lock` and `bmap` which I haven't used yet and are a bit complicated to bind, and `getdir` and `utime` which are obsolete.]];

Get file attributes. `stat` should be a table, with some of the following fields set:

- `dev`, number, ID of device containing file
- `ino`, number, inode number
- `mode`, a set or a string, file type and permissions. If mode is a set, it's made of the recognized mode flags listed below. If it's a string, it's one of the predefined modes described below.
- `nlink`, number, number of hard links
- `uid`, number, user ID of owner
- `gid`, number, group ID of owner
- `rdev`, number, device ID (if special file)
- `access`, number, time of last access
- `modification`, number, time of last modification
- `change`, number, time of last status change
- `size`, number, total size, in bytes
- `blocks`, number, number of blocks allocated
- `blksize`, number, blocksize for filesystem I/O

This table is compatible with LuaFileSystem, though the default access rights for `mode` strings (as described below) may not suit you.

The `dev` and `blksize` fields are ignored. The `ino` field is ignored except if the `use_ino` mount option is given.

Note that for the *find* command line utility to work in your filesystem, the `nlink` field must be properly filled. See [this FUSE FAQ entry](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FAQ#Why_doesnx27.t_find_work_on_my_filesystemx3f.) for more details.

Mode flags:

- `blk`, the file is a block device
- `chr`, the file is a character device
- `fifo`, the file is a FIFO
- `reg`, the file is a regular file
- `dir`, the file is a directory
- `lnk`, the file is a symbolic link
- `sock`, the file is a socket
- `rusr`, owner has read permission
- `wusr`, owner has write permission
- `xusr`, owner has execute permission
- `rgrp`, group has read permission
- `wgrp`, group has write permission
- `xgrp`, group has execute permission
- `roth`, others have read permission
- `woth`, others have write permission
- `xoth`, others have execute permission
- `suid`, set UID bit
- `sgid`, set-group-ID bit
- `svtx`, sticky bit

Predefined modes:

- `'file'`, equivalent to `reg`, `rusr`, `wusr`, `rgrp` and `wgrp`

So if a filesystem wants to return write errors in [`fs.close`](#fs.close) and the file has cached dirty data, this is a good place to write back data and raise any errors. Since many applications ignore [`fs.close`](#fs.close) errors this is not always useful.

NOTE: The [`fs.flush`](#fs.flush) method may be called more than once for each [`fs.open`](#fs.open). This happens if more than one file descriptor refers to an opened file due to dup(), dup2() or fork() calls. It is not possible to determine if a flush is final, so each flush should be treated equally. Multiple write-flush sequences are relatively rare, so this shouldn't be a problem.

## %chapterid%.1 - hellofs

`hellofs` is the Hello World! of FUSE filesystems. It creates a directory with a single file called `hello` that contain the string `"Hello World!"`.

Example:

    $ mkdir tmpdir
    $ ./hellofs.lua tmpdir

## %chapterid%.2 - luafs

`luafs` expose a table as a directory. The subtables are exposed as subdirectories, while the string fields are exposed as regular files. You can create new files, and write to them: that will create new strings in the table hierarchy.

Example:

    $ mkdir tmpdir
    $ ./luafs.lua tmpdir
    $ ls tmpdir
    $ echo Hello World! > tmpdir/hello
    $ ls tmpdir
    hello
    $ cat tmpdir/hello
    Hello World!
    $ mkdir tmpdir/subdir
    $ ls tmpdir
    hello subdir/
    $ echo foo > tmpdir/subdir/bar
    $ ls tmpdir/subdir
    bar
    $ cat tmpdir/subdir/bar
    foo
    $ fusermount -u tmpdir

Source code: [luafs.lua](http://piratery.net/flu/luafs.lua)

]], --[[
## %chapterid%.3 - fwfs

`fwfs` creates a directory that will forward all I/O to another directory. It's meant to be used as a base for any filesystem that is backed on disk, and that is doing something to the files on the fly. For example it can do filesystem encryption, it can make several directories on different disks appear as a single one, etc.

Example:
    $ mkdir srcdir
    $ echo Hello World! > srcdir/hello
    $ mkdir dstdir
    $ ./fwfs.lua srcdir dstdir
    $ ls dstdir
    hello
    $ cat dstdir/hello
    Hello World!
    $ mkdir dstdir/subdir
    $ ls srcdir
    hello subdir/
    $ echo foo > dstdir/subdir/bar
    $ ls srcdir/subdir
    bar
    $ cat srcdir/subdir/bar
    foo
    $ fusermount -u dstdir
